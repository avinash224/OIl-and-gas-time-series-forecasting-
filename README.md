# OIL AND NATURAL GAS STATISTICAL OVERVIEW AND PREDICTION

Dataset Description :
The data file for information pertaining to annual oil and gas production is released on or about July 1st each year following the legislatively mandated six month period of confidentiality. The NY state Division offers production data via the searchable online database with production histories from 1985 forward and in zipped comma-separated values files from 2002 forward. However, the data set that we are currently using contains annual production information of oil and gas wells in New York State from 2001 to 2019. It is publicly available and can be downloaded from the following link https://data.ny.gov/api/views/mxea-iw3u/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD

Goal of the project :
There is a constant debate on if the oil and gas prices are affecting each other. In Investopedia's article wriiten by TIM SMITH and updated on Jan 22, 2021, we have found that between 2003 and 2008, there was an evident positive correlation between the two commoditiesâ€”ranging from 0.25 to >0.65. Through this Notebook we are trying to analyse

1) if the production of oil and gas during that period were also correlated or not?
2) What could be the possible future trends for the production of oil and gas?

Process :
We will begin the project by analsysing the trends shown over the past 20 years in the oil and gas commodities. Drill down to understand the correlation between both commodities. From there, we will take a sample of the data between reporting year 2003- 2008 to see if the data show significant correlation or not when comapred with the prices of those 2 commodities. We will also have a look on the possible future trends of both the comodities and provide suggestion on whether it is advisable to invest in those sectors or not.
